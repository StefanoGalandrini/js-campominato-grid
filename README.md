# js-campominato-grid

# There was a problem when, with some widths and number of cells in a row, you could see small empty spaces between the cells and the border of the container.

# To prevent that, the base dimension of the container is defined in javascript and can be modified.

# Also, the width and height of cells is rounded to an integer. Then is multiplied for the number of cells in a row and applied as an inline style to the container.

# Unfortunately I couldn't find a better solution...
